Hi, I’m @jps1990 - Jean-Philippe S. ☀️

👋 Welcome to my GitHub page

I’m diving into the wild world of AI Technology, Image Generation, Chatbots, and all things Multimedia. Basically, if it involves pixels or a bot pretending to care, I'm interested.

About Me:

🌱 Currently learning: Web & App coding. Or more accurately, learning how to "Ctrl+C" and "Ctrl+V" my way through it. But hey, that still counts, right?

👀 What I’m into: AI, Multimedia magic, Chatbot wizardry, and anything that generates, modifies, or just looks cool.

💞️ Looking to collaborate on: Small projects! Not quite a full-fledged coder yet, but I can piece things together pretty well. Think of me as the IKEA of coding: assembly required, but surprisingly functional.

📫 Reach me at:

📧 jprocker13@gmail.com

📧 jeamphilippesaumier@gmail.com

You can find me here when I’m not breaking my apps.

⚡ Fun Fact: Currently juggling 5-6 apps in various stages of "will-it-work?" One's actually live! Check it out: HyperfluxAI – shoutout to Render for making it happen.

😄 Pronouns: Mr. Sunboom (yes, really).
